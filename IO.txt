This describes the I/O procedure for terniac.
(At time of writing, only output is working)

The overall idea is MMIO with rudimentary locking.

Reserve two buffers in memory, one for input, one for output.
Reserve a "lock" tryte for each buffer. (OUTLOCK and INLOCK)
Reserve a "new" tryte for each buffer. (OUTNEW and INNEW)

To output, the code running on terniac software will:
	wait until OUTNEW=0
	set the OUTLOCK to a nonzero value
	populate the buffer with the outut characters.
	set OUTNEW to a nonzero value
	reset OUTLOCK to zero

To display output, the terminal will: 
	wait until OUTLOCK=0 and OUTNEW=1
	print and zero each buffer location
	reset OUTNEW to zero

To input, the terminal will:
	wait until INNEW=0
	read text until a newline or until buffer size is reached.
	set INLOCK to a nonzero value
	zero the input buffer to remove prior input
	populate the input buffer with the input characters
	set INNEW to a nonzero value
	reset INLOCK to zero
	
to read input, the software running on terniac will:
	wait until INLOCK=0 and INNEW=1
	read the values from the input buffer
	reset INNEW to zero
